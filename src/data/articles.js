Before ES2015 which saw the introduction of the class syntax, JavaScript relied heavily upon constructor functions to create objects and the prototype chain or __proto__ for inheritance. We are going to take a look a look at how this works and how it compares to classical inheritance ",

        You are given a hash table where the key is a course code, and the value is a list of all the course codes that are prerequisites for the key. Return a valid ordering in which we can complete the courses. If no such ordering exists, return NULL.

        {
        'CSC300': ['CSC100', 'CSC200'], 
        'CSC200': ['CSC100'],

        This input should return the order that we need to take these courses:
        ['CSC100', 'CSC200', 'CSCS300']
